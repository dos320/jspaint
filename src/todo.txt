stuff to do:
- change name button
- random name colours upon socket connection
- add word to guess and implement logic
  - server sends signal to each connected client
    - same signal for all except for the drawer
    - signal for the drawer enables them to see the word, and enables drawing on the canvas
    - signal for the others obfuscates the word (shows the length), and disables drawing on the canvas
- add timer and implement logic

- show current connected users
- different rooms, eventually move to connecting to rooms using room codes
- add reconnection stuff (repopulating different elements, etc.)

- add scoring
- disallow the artist to answer on their turn to draw (loop through currentUsers and check if all people apart from the artist have drawn???)

- break in between words
- disallow people other than the artist to draw when it's not their turn
