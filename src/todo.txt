stuff to do:
- change name button
- random name colours upon socket connection
- add word to guess and implement logic
  - server sends signal to each connected client
    - same signal for all except for the drawer
    - signal for the drawer enables them to see the word, and enables drawing on the canvas
    - signal for the others obfuscates the word (shows the length), and disables drawing on the canvas
- different rooms, eventually move to connecting to rooms using room codes
- add reconnection stuff (repopulating different elements, etc.)
- add more QoL stuff
